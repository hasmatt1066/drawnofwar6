# Isometric Battlefield - Hex Grid Alignment Fix - COMPLETE

**Date**: January 5, 2025
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Feature**: Isometric Hex Grid Battlefield with Drag-and-Drop Deployment

---

## Problem Summary

After implementing isometric projection (2:1 dimetric) for the hex grid battlefield, drag-and-drop creature placement had visual alignment issues:

1. **Phase 1**: Drag preview (creature circle) appeared far to the right of the cursor
2. **Phase 2**: Green hex highlight appeared offset from the cursor position (rendering outside visible board area)

---

## Root Cause

The `DeploymentGridRenderer.ts` had **inconsistent offset calculations** across different rendering methods. Some methods were updated to use the new `calculateGridBounds()` function that accounts for isometric projection, while others still used the old flat grid calculations.

### Old Calculation (Incorrect for Isometric)
```typescript
const gridPixelWidth = width * this.hexGrid.hexSize * 1.5;
const gridPixelHeight = height * this.hexGrid.hexSize * Math.sqrt(3);
const offsetX = (this.config.canvasWidth - gridPixelWidth) / 2;
const offsetY = (this.config.canvasHeight - gridPixelHeight) / 2;
```

### New Calculation (Correct for Isometric)
```typescript
const isIsometric = this.config.hexGridConfig.projection === 'isometric';
const bounds = this.calculateGridBounds(); // Samples edge hexes AFTER projection
const verticalBias = isIsometric ? 50 : 0;
const offsetX = (this.config.canvasWidth - bounds.width) / 2 - bounds.minX;
const offsetY = (this.config.canvasHeight - bounds.height) / 2 - bounds.minY + verticalBias;
```

## Files Changed

### 1. `/frontend/src/components/DeploymentGrid/DeploymentGridRenderer.ts`

**Methods Updated** (All now use `calculateGridBounds()`):

#### Phase 1 Fixes:
- **Lines 356-361**: `setupInteraction()` - PixiJS mouse event handling
- **Lines 480-485**: `renderCoordinates()` - Debug coordinate label positioning

#### Phase 2 Fixes:
- **Lines 415-420**: `createHighlight()` - Hex highlight rendering

**Debug Logging Added**:
- **Line 397**: `updateHighlight()` - Entry point logging
- **Lines 424-430**: `createHighlight()` - Detailed position calculation logging
- **Lines 773-779**: `renderDragPreview()` - Detailed position calculation logging

### 2. `/frontend/src/pages/DeploymentGridDemoPage.tsx`

**Canvas Size Updates**:
- **Line 374**: Container max-width: `1000px` → `1200px`
- **Line 376**: Canvas width: `1000` → `1200`
- **Line 377**: Canvas height: `600` → `700`
- **Line 378**: Hex size: `32` → `38`

---

## All Methods Now Consistent

✅ **7 out of 7 methods** now use `calculateGridBounds()` for coordinate transformations:

1. `renderStaticGrid()` - Grid hex rendering
2. `setupInteraction()` - Mouse/pointer event handling
3. `renderCoordinates()` - Debug coordinate text
4. `createHighlight()` - Hex highlight rendering
5. `renderCreature()` - Creature sprite rendering
6. `renderDragPreview()` - Drag preview rendering
7. `getHexAtPixel()` - Pixel-to-hex conversion

## Critical Discovery: Vite Cache Issue

### Problem
Even after fixing the code in all 7 methods, the changes weren't loading in the browser. The old buggy code continued to run even in:
- Incognito browser mode
- Multiple dev server restarts
- Multiple port changes (5176 → 5177 → 5178)

### Root Cause
Vite was serving **cached JavaScript bundles** from `node_modules/.vite/` directory. Hot Module Reload (HMR) was failing to detect the changes, causing the old code to persist.

### Solution
```bash
# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# Clear dist folder
rm -rf dist

# Restart dev server (picked port 5179)
pnpm dev
```

### Verification
After clearing cache, debug logs appeared in console confirming new code was loaded:
- `[updateHighlight] CALLED` - Showed method entry
- `[createHighlight]` - Showed offset calculations
- `[renderDragPreview]` - Showed offset calculations
- All offset values were **identical**, confirming consistent calculations

---

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Drag preview appeared far to the right of cursor
- ❌ Mouse-to-hex conversion worked but visual was misaligned
- ❌ Green highlight rendered outside visible board area
- ❌ Different offset calculations across methods

### After Fix (Port 5179, Cleared Cache)
- ✅ Drag preview follows cursor accurately
- ✅ Green hex highlight aligns perfectly with cursor position
- ✅ Mouse-to-hex conversion accurate (e.g., `{q: 2, r: 1}`)
- ✅ Hex hover detection: 100% accurate
- ✅ Placement validation working correctly
- ✅ All offset calculations identical across methods
- ✅ No visual offset between cursor, highlight, and creature preview
- ✅ Placement success: true

## Technical Details

### Isometric Projection
- **Type**: 2:1 dimetric projection (26.565° angle)
- **Forward transform**: `x_iso = (x - y) * 0.5`, `y_iso = (x + y) * 0.25`
- **Reverse transform**: `x = x_iso + 2 * y_iso`, `y = -x_iso + 2 * y_iso`

### Grid Configuration
- **Dimensions**: 12×8 hexes
- **Hex size**: 38px radius
- **Canvas**: 1200×700px
- **Orientation**: Flat-top hexagons
- **Projection**: Isometric (2:1 dimetric)
- **Vertical bias**: 50px (improves visual balance in isometric view)

### Deployment Zones
- **Player 1**: Blue zone (columns 0-2, left side)
- **Player 2**: Red zone (columns 9-11, right side)

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Consistency is Critical**: When implementing coordinate transformations, ALL methods must use the same calculation approach
2. **Vite Cache Can Persist**: HMR doesn't always work reliably. When debugging, always try clearing `node_modules/.vite/`
3. **Debug Logging is Essential**: Without the debug logs, we wouldn't have known the old code was still running
4. **Incognito ≠ Fresh Code**: Browser incognito mode doesn't bypass Vite's build cache
5. **Isometric Math Requires Special Handling**: Standard grid calculations break with projection transformations

---

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - The isometric hex grid battlefield is fully functional with:

- **Accurate mouse-to-hex detection** - Cursor position correctly maps to hex coordinates
- **Aligned creature preview circles** - Drag preview follows cursor precisely
- **Aligned hex highlights** - Green (valid) / Red (invalid) highlights appear under cursor
- **Centered grid layout** - Proper isometric perspective with 50px vertical bias
- **Full drag-and-drop** - Place creatures from roster onto deployment zones
- **Multiplayer sync** - Socket.IO syncs placements between players
- **Consistent coordinate system** - All 7 rendering methods use identical offset calculations

**Final Verification**: User confirmed "Ok, this is fixed, great!" after testing on port 5179

**Server**: http://localhost:5179/deployment-grid
**Verified**: January 5, 2025

## Next Steps

The isometric battlefield is now ready for:
- Combat phase implementation
- Creature animations during battle
- Ability/spell visual effects
- Turn-based combat logic

No further alignment fixes needed - the coordinate transformation system is solid.
