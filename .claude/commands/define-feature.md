# Feature Definition: $ARGUMENTS

I'll work with you to break down this feature into small, testable units that can be implemented correctly and incrementally.

## Feature Analysis Process

### Step 1: Feature Context
First, let me understand the feature's place in the system:

```
Task("Load parent epic and related features for $ARGUMENTS", context-manager)
Task("Analyze feature scope and boundaries", feature-analyst)
```

### Step 2: Detailed Breakdown
The feature analyst will:
- Decompose into atomic tasks
- Define precise interfaces
- Specify test scenarios
- Identify dependencies

```
Task("Create detailed feature breakdown for $ARGUMENTS", feature-analyst)
```

### Step 3: Test Strategy
The test strategist will:
- Design comprehensive test cases
- Define test data needs
- Plan test automation
- Identify edge cases

```
Task("Develop test strategy for feature $ARGUMENTS", test-strategist)
```

### Step 4: Technical Review
Before implementation approval:
- Validate technical approach
- Check integration impacts
- Ensure security compliance
- Confirm performance targets

```
Task("Validate feature design for $ARGUMENTS", design-validator)
Task("Review security implications for $ARGUMENTS", security-engineer)
```

## Feature Definition Questions

The specialists will explore:

### Functionality
- What exactly should this feature do?
- What are the inputs and outputs?
- What validations are needed?
- How does it handle errors?

### Implementation
- What's the smallest useful version?
- Can we break it down further?
- What's the implementation order?
- What can be deferred?

### Testing
- How do we know it works?
- What are the edge cases?
- What could go wrong?
- How do we test failure scenarios?

### Integration
- What does this feature depend on?
- What depends on this feature?
- How does it affect existing code?
- What are the performance implications?

## Deliverables

This process will produce:

1. **Task List**: Atomic, implementable units
2. **Interface Specs**: Exact inputs/outputs
3. **Test Plan**: Comprehensive test scenarios
4. **Implementation Order**: Dependencies considered
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success definition

Each task will be small enough to:
- Implement in a few hours
- Test in isolation
- Review easily
- Deploy safely
