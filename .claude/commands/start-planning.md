# Planning Session: $ARGUMENTS

I'm initiating a planning session to deeply understand your requirements. Let me ask clarifying questions to ensure we build exactly what you envision.

## Planning Context

First, let me understand what documentation level this relates to:
- Is this exploring a new Vision (L0)?
- Defining Themes (L1)?
- Designing an Epic (L2)?
- Specifying a Feature (L3)?

Based on your topic "$ARGUMENTS", I'll engage the appropriate planning specialist.

## Initiating Planning Specialist

```
Task("Begin planning session for $ARGUMENTS", [appropriate-planning-agent])
```

The specialist will:
1. Review any existing related documentation
2. Ask comprehensive clarifying questions
3. Surface potential technical considerations
4. Identify edge cases and scenarios
5. Document all decisions and reasoning

## Session Structure

This planning session will proceed through:
1. **Discovery Questions** - Understanding the core need
2. **Scope Definition** - What's included/excluded
3. **Technical Exploration** - Feasibility and approach
4. **Edge Case Analysis** - What could go wrong
5. **Success Criteria** - How we measure completion

The specialist will guide you through each phase, ensuring nothing is overlooked.

Let's begin the detailed planning process...
