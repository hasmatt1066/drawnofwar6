# Epic Refinement: $ARGUMENTS

I'll conduct a thorough refinement session for this epic to ensure all technical details are clear before we proceed to feature definition.

## Current Epic Status

Checking epic documentation...

```
Task("Review epic documentation for $ARGUMENTS", context-manager)
Task("Analyze epic for completeness", requirements-reviewer)
```

## Epic Refinement Process

### Phase 1: Epic Review
The epic designer will:
- Review current epic definition
- Identify gaps or ambiguities
- Prepare targeted questions

```
Task("Conduct epic deep-dive for $ARGUMENTS", epic-designer)
```

### Phase 2: Technical Analysis
The technical advisor will:
- Assess architectural implications
- Identify technical risks
- Suggest implementation patterns

```
Task("Provide technical assessment for epic $ARGUMENTS", technical-advisor)
```

### Phase 3: Quality Gates
Before proceeding to features:
- Verify all user stories are complete
- Ensure acceptance criteria are testable
- Confirm technical approach is sound

```
Task("Validate epic readiness for $ARGUMENTS", requirements-reviewer)
Task("Review epic design for $ARGUMENTS", design-validator)
```

## Refinement Questions

The specialists will explore:

1. **User Journey Clarification**
   - Entry points and triggers
   - Step-by-step flow
   - Success and failure paths
   - User feedback needed

2. **System Design Details**
   - Data models required
   - API contracts
   - Integration points
   - Performance requirements

3. **Edge Cases & Errors**
   - Failure scenarios
   - Recovery procedures
   - Data consistency
   - User communication

4. **Technical Decisions**
   - Technology choices
   - Architectural patterns
   - Security considerations
   - Scalability approach

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this refinement:
- [ ] Complete user stories with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical design documented
- [ ] Edge cases identified and addressed
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Ready for feature breakdown
