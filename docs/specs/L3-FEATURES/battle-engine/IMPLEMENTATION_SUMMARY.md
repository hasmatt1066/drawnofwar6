## Recommendations

### For Completing Specifications

1. **Priority Order**: Focus on combat-critical features first
   - Damage Calculation (foundation for all combat)
   - Combat Resolution (core combat loop)
   - Pathfinding (unit movement)
   - Abilities (strategic depth)
   - Buffs/Debuffs (final polish)

2. **Specification Quality**: Follow PixelLab API Client example
   - Detailed functional requirements
   - Complete technical specification with code examples
   - Comprehensive L4 task breakdown
   - Clear success criteria
   - Testing strategy with examples

3. **Time Management**: Budget 6-8 hours per L3 feature
   - Complex features (Pathfinding, Abilities): 8 hours
   - Medium features (Damage, Combat): 6 hours
   - Simpler features (Buffs): 4 hours

### For Implementation

1. **Start Early**: Begin Hex Math Library now (fully specified)
2. **Parallel Work**: Grid Rendering can start alongside Math Library
3. **Validation First**: Complete Deployment Validation before Drag-Drop
4. **Test Coverage**: Maintain 90%+ coverage from day one
5. **Weekly Milestones**: Ship working features every 1-2 weeks
