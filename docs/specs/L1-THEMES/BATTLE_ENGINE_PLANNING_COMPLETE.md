# Battle Engine Planning - Complete ✅

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Status**: L1 Theme Refined, L2 Epics Complete, L3 Features (Critical Path) Complete

---

## Executive Summary

The Battle Engine theme has been fully planned as a **Mechabellum-style multi-round auto-battler** with hex grid tactical deployment. All planning documentation follows the documentation-driven development system (L0 → L1 → L2 → L3 → L4).

### Strategic Decisions Made

Based on Mechabellum research and user preferences:

1. ✅ **Multi-Round Battles** - Best-of-5/7 with progression between rounds
2. ✅ **Grid-Based Deployment** - Hex grid for tactical positioning
3. ✅ **Simultaneous Blind Deployment** - Both players place without seeing opponent
4. ✅ **Fixed 8 Creatures** - Each player deploys exactly 8 creatures per round
5. ✅ **Pure Auto-Battle** - No player intervention during combat phase

### Core Gameplay Loop

```
Match Start (Best-of-5)
  ↓
Round 1: Deployment Phase
  - Both players place 8 creatures on hex grid (blind)
  - 60-second timer
  - Budget: $500 starting
  ↓
Combat Phase (Auto-Battle)
  - Units advance and fight autonomously
  - Simple AI: target closest enemy
  - Rock-paper-scissors counters
  - Battle runs 60-120 seconds
  ↓
Round Result
  - Winner gets +1 score, +$50 income
  - Both players get +$100 base income
  ↓
Round 2-5: Repeat deployment → combat
  - Adapt strategy based on previous rounds
  - Use accumulated budget strategically
  ↓
Match Victory
  - First to 3 wins (Best-of-5)
  - Or first to 4 wins (Best-of-7)
```

```typescript
- MatchOrchestrator: Multi-round session management
- DeploymentCoordinator: Simultaneous blind deployment
- CombatSimulator: 60 tick/sec authoritative simulation
- HexPathfinder: A* pathfinding on hex grid
- AbilityExecutor: Automated ability usage
- StateSerializer: Delta compression for network sync
```

**Client-Side** (React + PixiJS + Socket.IO):
```typescript
- HexGridRenderer: PixiJS hex battlefield
- DragDropController: Creature placement UI
- AnimationController: Animation state machine + library integration
- StateInterpolator: 100-150ms latency compensation

- Distance calculations, neighbor finding
- Line of sight, range queries
- Pathfinding cost estimation
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Animation Library** (55 pre-generated effects):
- Ranged abilities: cast → projectile spawn → travel → hit
- Melee abilities: swing → frame-based hit (frame 3)
- Blend modes: ADD (flashes), SCREEN (glows), OVERLAY (status)

**AI Generation Pipeline** (creature stats):
- Creatures generated with fixed stats
- 6-18 animations assigned per creature archetype
- Rock-paper-scissors type assignment (melee/ranged/magic)

**Multi-View Support**:
- Use isometric view for battlefield rendering
- Side view for creature portraits/menus

## Open Questions

### High Priority (Blocking Implementation)

1. **Match Format**: Best-of-5 default, or both BO5 and BO7 options?
2. **Hex Orientation**: Flat-top or pointy-top hexagons?
3. **Deployment Timer**: 60 seconds sufficient for 8-creature placement?
4. **Armor Formula**: Linear reduction or percentage-based?
5. **Critical Hits**: Keep 10% chance or remove for determinism?

### Medium Priority (Implementation Details)

6. **Creature Costs**: Formula based on stats, or fixed archetypes?
7. **Battle Timeout**: 2 minutes per round, or dynamic based on unit count?
8. **Targeting AI**: Pure closest enemy, or consider unit priority (DPS > Tank > Support)?

### Low Priority (Post-MVP)

9. **Reconnection Grace Period**: 30 seconds to rejoin or instant forfeit?
10. **Pathfinding Costs**: Uniform grid or terrain-based movement costs?

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **Balancing AI-Generated Creatures** (Severity: High)
   - **Issue**: Infinite creature variety vs Mechabellum's 25 fixed units
   - **Mitigation**: Archetype-based normalization, power budget formula
   - **Contingency**: Post-generation stat adjustments, statistical balancing

2. **Animation Synchronization** (Severity: Medium-High)
   - **Issue**: Projectile spawn timing, frame-based hit detection
   - **Mitigation**: Proven via SpellCastDemo/MeleeAttackDemo POCs
   - **Contingency**: Server-side animation timeline validation

### Medium Risk

3. **Hex Pathfinding Performance** (Severity: Medium)
   - **Issue**: A* on 12×8 grid with 16 units, 60 tps
   - **Mitigation**: Hierarchical pathfinding, cached paths
   - **Contingency**: Reduce tick rate to 30 tps if needed

4. **Network Latency Compensation** (Severity: Medium)
   - **Issue**: 100-150ms RTT smooth rendering
   - **Mitigation**: Client-side interpolation, dead reckoning
   - **Contingency**: Server tick rate reduction, lower FPS target

### Low Risk

5. **Economy Balance** (Severity: Low)
   - **Issue**: Starting budget, income rates, creature costs
   - **Mitigation**: Playtesting, iterative tuning
   - **Contingency**: Easy numerical adjustments
