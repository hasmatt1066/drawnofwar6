# Combat Visualization Fix Report

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Combat Socket Join Not Working
**Problem**: Backend showed clients connected but never joined the combat room
**Root Cause**: Socket join promise was not properly handling the wait-for-connect scenario
**Fix**:
- Added explicit `connect` event listener when socket is not yet connected
- Added timeout protection (5 seconds) to prevent hanging
- Added comprehensive logging at every step of the join process

**Files Changed**:
- `/frontend/src/services/combat-socket.ts` - Enhanced join() method with better connection handling and logging

### Issue 2: Missing Backend Logs for Join Events
**Problem**: Backend wasn't logging when clients joined combat rooms
**Root Cause**: Minimal logging made it hard to debug the join flow
**Fix**:
- Added detailed logging in `handleJoinCombat()`
- Log when join request received, room joined, state sent, and confirmation emitted
- Added broadcast logging to show how many clients are receiving states

**Files Changed**:
- `/backend/src/sockets/combat-socket.ts` - Enhanced logging in join handler and broadcasting

### Issue 3: Combat Canvas Empty / State Not Received
**Problem**: CombatVisualizationManager not receiving combat states
**Root Cause**:
1. Socket join was failing silently
2. Socket adapter callbacks were registered but never triggered
3. No logging to trace state flow

**Fix**:
- Set `combatActive = true` AFTER all initialization completes (moved from beginning to end)
- Added detailed logging for every state update
- Added logging in socket adapter to trace callback registration and invocation
- Added combat event processing to populate combat log

**Files Changed**:
- `/frontend/src/pages/DeploymentGridDemoPage.tsx` - Reordered combat initialization, added comprehensive logging

### Issue 4: Combat Log Empty
**Problem**: "No combat events yet" even when combat was running
**Root Cause**: Events weren't being added to combat log from state updates
**Fix**:
- Process state.events array and add to combat log
- Log damage, death, and tick events
- Show last 5 events from each state update

**Files Changed**:
- `/frontend/src/pages/DeploymentGridDemoPage.tsx` - Added event processing in state update handler

### Issue 5: UI Layout - Combat Below Deployment
**Problem**: Combat canvas showed BELOW deployment grid instead of replacing it
**Root Cause**: Both sections were always rendered, combat just appended
**Fix**:
- Wrap deployment section in `{!combatActive && ...}`
- Combat section remains `{combatActive && ...}`
- Now they toggle - only one shows at a time

**Files Changed**:
- `/frontend/src/pages/DeploymentGridDemoPage.tsx` - Added conditional rendering

## Logging Improvements

### Frontend Console Logs
All logs now prefixed with `[DeploymentDemo]` or `[Combat Socket]`:

**Combat Start Flow**:
```
[DeploymentDemo] ===== COMBAT STARTED =====
[DeploymentDemo] Match ID: a0a161b2...
[Combat Socket] join() called with matchId: a0a161b2...
[Combat Socket] Emitting combat:join for match a0a161b2...
[Combat Socket] ✓ Successfully joined match a0a161b2...
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Successfully joined combat socket
[DeploymentDemo] Initializing combat grid renderer...
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Combat grid renderer initialized
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Canvas added to DOM
[DeploymentDemo] Creating socket adapter...
[DeploymentDemo] Creating CombatVisualizationManager...
[DeploymentDemo] Starting visualization manager...
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Combat visualization manager started
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Combat active flag set
```

**Combat State Updates**:
```
[DeploymentDemo] ===== COMBAT STATE UPDATE =====
[DeploymentDemo] Tick: 42
[DeploymentDemo] Units: 8
[DeploymentDemo] Projectiles: 2
[DeploymentDemo] Events: 5
```

**Combat Completion**:
```
[DeploymentDemo] ===== COMBAT COMPLETED =====
[DeploymentDemo] Winner: player2
```

### Backend Server Logs
All logs now prefixed with `[Combat Socket]`:

**Client Connection & Join**:
```
[Combat Socket] Client connected: wBanj3W2v-gPx5NmAAAG
[Combat Socket] Client wBanj3W2v-gPx5NmAAAG requesting to join match a0a161b2...
[Combat Socket] ✓ Client wBanj3W2v-gPx5NmAAAG joined room combat:a0a161b2...
[Combat Socket] No active combat state for match a0a161b2...
[Combat Socket] Emitting combat:joined to wBanj3W2v-gPx5NmAAAG
```

**Broadcasting**:
```
[Combat Socket] ✓ Started broadcasting for match a0a161b2..., 2 clients in room combat:a0a161b2...
[Combat Socket] Broadcasting state tick 10 to 2 clients in room combat:a0a161b2... (every 1 second)
[Combat Socket] Broadcasting state tick 20 to 2 clients in room combat:a0a161b2...
```

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Two Browser Tabs
1. Tab 1 (Player 1): `http://localhost:5173/deployment?matchId=test123&playerId=player1`
2. Tab 2 (Player 2): `http://localhost:5173/deployment?matchId=test123&playerId=player2`

### Step 3: Deploy Creatures
- Each player drag 8 creatures to deployment zone
- Click "Mark Ready" on both tabs
- Wait for 3-second countdown

### Step 4: Verify Combat Starts
**Expected Frontend Logs (Tab 1)**:
```
[DeploymentDemo] ===== COMBAT STARTED =====
[Combat Socket] join() called with matchId: test123
[Combat Socket] Socket exists, connected: true
[Combat Socket] Emitting combat:join for match test123
[Combat Socket] ✓ Successfully joined match test123 in room combat:test123
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Successfully joined combat socket
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Combat grid renderer initialized
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Canvas added to DOM
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Combat visualization manager started
[DeploymentDemo] ✓ Combat active flag set
```

**Expected Backend Logs**:
```
[Combat Socket] Client abc123 requesting to join match test123
[Combat Socket] ✓ Client abc123 joined room combat:test123
[Combat Socket] Sending current combat state (tick 0) to abc123
[Combat Socket] Emitting combat:joined to abc123
[Combat Socket] ✓ Started broadcasting for match test123, 2 clients in room combat:test123
```

### Step 5: Verify State Updates
**Expected Frontend (every tick)**:
```
[DeploymentDemo] ===== COMBAT STATE UPDATE =====
[DeploymentDemo] Tick: 1
[DeploymentDemo] Units: 16
[DeploymentDemo] Projectiles: 0
[DeploymentDemo] Events: 0
```

**Expected Backend (every second)**:
```
[Combat Socket] Broadcasting state tick 10 to 2 clients in room combat:test123
[Combat Socket] Broadcasting state tick 20 to 2 clients in room combat:test123
```

### Step 6: Verify Visual Elements
1. **Deployment Grid Hidden**: Roster and grid should disappear when combat starts
2. **Combat Canvas Visible**: Red-bordered combat section appears in same location
3. **Combat Log Populated**: Right panel shows "Tick X" entries
4. **Combat Stats**: Shows current tick, player 1 units, player 2 units
5. **Canvas Rendering**: Hex grid with units should be visible (if renderer is working)

### Step 7: Verify Combat Completion
**Expected Frontend**:
```
[DeploymentDemo] ===== COMBAT COMPLETED =====
[DeploymentDemo] Winner: player2
[DeploymentDemo] Result: { winner: 'player2', ... }
```

**Expected Backend**:
```
[Combat Socket] Combat completed for match test123, winner: player2
[Combat Socket] No state found, stopping broadcast for match test123
[Combat Socket] Stopped broadcasting for match test123
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Socket Connection**: Backend logs show "Client X joined room combat:Y"
✅ **State Reception**: Frontend logs show "COMBAT STATE UPDATE" every tick
✅ **Combat Log**: Shows tick numbers and events
✅ **UI Layout**: Deployment grid hidden, combat canvas visible
✅ **Canvas Rendering**: Hex grid visible (units may not render if sprites missing)
✅ **Completion**: Winner displayed, combat ends cleanly

## Known Limitations

1. **Unit Sprites**: May not render if creature sprites aren't available in combat state
2. **Animation**: CombatVisualizationManager render loop is running but visual effects may not show
3. **Combat Grid Renderer**: May need additional work to properly render units from combat state

These are separate issues from the socket connection and should be addressed in follow-up tasks.

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `/frontend/src/pages/DeploymentGridDemoPage.tsx` - Combat initialization, logging, UI layout
- `/frontend/src/services/combat-socket.ts` - Join method enhancement, timeout, logging

### Backend
- `/backend/src/sockets/combat-socket.ts` - Join handler logging, broadcast logging

## Next Steps

After verifying these fixes work:

1. **Task: Combat Grid Renderer Integration** - Ensure CombatGridRenderer can render units from CombatState
2. **Task: Unit Sprite Loading** - Load creature sprites for combat visualization
3. **Task: Animation Playback** - Ensure animations play when units attack/move
4. **Task: Visual Effects** - Verify health bars, damage numbers, projectiles render
