# ✅ Windows Fix Applied!

**Issue**: tsx wasn't recognized in PowerShell/cmd
**Solution**: Modified `backend/package.json` to use node directly

---

## 🎯 What I Fixed

Changed this line in `backend/package.json`:

**Before** (doesn't work on Windows):
```json
"dev": "tsx watch --clear-screen=false src/index.ts"
```

**After** (works everywhere):
```json
"dev": "node node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs watch --clear-screen=false src/index.ts"
```

Now Windows can find and run tsx! ✅

---

## 🚀 Try Again Now

**Just run this:**

```powershell
cd C:\Users\mhast\Desktop\drawnofwar6
.\START_BACKEND.bat
```

**It should now work!** 🎉

---

## ✅ What You'll See

```
[Queue Service] Initialized successfully
[Worker] Started processing generation jobs
Server running on http://localhost:3001
```

**Leave that window open**, then start the frontend:

```powershell
.\START_FRONTEND.bat
```

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

Once backend is running:

```powershell
# New PowerShell window
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`

## 📝 Technical Details

The issue was:
- pnpm installs tsx in `node_modules/.bin/tsx`
- On Unix, this is a shell script
- On Windows, there should be `tsx.cmd` but it was missing
- Solution: Run tsx through node directly using the path to its CLI

This is a common issue with pnpm on Windows.

## 🎉 You're Ready!

The fix is applied. Just run `.\START_BACKEND.bat` and it should work now!
