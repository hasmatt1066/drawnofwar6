# Prompt Builder Documentation Cleanup - Quick Reference

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Type**: Consolidation and Archive

---

## What Happened

During the `/define-feature Prompt Builder System` process, multiple documents were created:
1. A subagent created `prompt-builder-simplified.md`
2. The orchestrator created `PROMPT-BUILDER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` in the root
3. The orchestrator also UPDATED `prompt-builder.md` with the simplified spec

This resulted in redundant documentation that needed cleanup.

---

## What Changed

### Kept Active (Source of Truth)
- âœ… `/docs/specs/L3-FEATURES/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder.md` - Main L3 spec (SIMPLIFIED)
- âœ… `/docs/specs/L4-TASKS/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder-tasks.md` - L4 task breakdown

### Archived (This Directory)
- ðŸ“¦ `prompt-builder-simplified-2025-10-01.md` - Interim L3 spec (redundant)
- ðŸ“¦ `PROMPT-BUILDER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2025-10-01.md` - Planning doc (content integrated)
- ðŸ“„ `CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md` - Detailed cleanup report (read this for full details)

---

## Source of Truth

**File**: `/docs/specs/L3-FEATURES/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder.md`

This file contains the SIMPLIFIED Prompt Builder specification:
- Single text input (no complex forms)
- Rule-based enhancement service
- 50+ creature templates
- 32-40 hour implementation estimate
- 4 implementation phases

---

## Why These Files Were Archived

### `prompt-builder-simplified.md`
- Created by subagent at 09:28:21
- Superseded by `prompt-builder.md` update at 09:34:21 (6 minutes later)
- ~80% content overlap with the updated prompt-builder.md
- Caused confusion about which was the source of truth

### `PROMPT-BUILDER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
- Created in wrong location (root instead of /docs/planning/)
- All content incorporated into the L3 spec
- Was an interim deliverable during the /define-feature process

---

## How to Use Archived Files

These files are preserved for historical reference:
- Understand how the spec evolved
- See subagent coordination process
- Review decision-making rationale
- Compare alternative approaches considered

**Do NOT use these for implementation** - use the active L3 spec instead.

---

## Next Steps

1. Review L3 spec: `/docs/specs/L3-FEATURES/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder.md`
2. Review L4 tasks: `/docs/specs/L4-TASKS/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder-tasks.md`
3. Begin implementation with `/implement-task T-003-001`
