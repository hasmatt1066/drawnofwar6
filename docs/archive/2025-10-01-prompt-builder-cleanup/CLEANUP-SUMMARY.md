# Prompt Builder Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Cleanup Type**: Consolidation and Archive
**Reason**: Eliminate redundancy after `/define-feature Prompt Builder System` update

---

## Executive Summary

This cleanup consolidated Prompt Builder documentation from 4 files to 2 active files, archiving redundant/interim documents. The source of truth is now clearly established as `/docs/specs/L3-FEATURES/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder.md` (the simplified spec).

### Result
- **Before**: 4 documents (2 in specs, 1 in root, 1 L4 tasks)
- **After**: 2 active documents (1 L3 spec, 1 L4 tasks)
- **Archived**: 2 redundant documents

---

## Files Analyzed

### 1. `/docs/specs/L3-FEATURES/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder.md`
**Status**: KEPT (Source of Truth)
**Last Modified**: 2025-10-01 09:34:21
**Description**: Main L3 Feature Specification for Prompt Builder (Simplified)

**Content Summary**:
- Feature ID: F-003
- Feature Name: Prompt Builder (Simplified)
- Estimated Effort: 32-40 hours (1 sprint)

- Follows documentation-driven development standards

---

### 2. `/docs/specs/L3-FEATURES/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder-simplified.md`
**Status**: ARCHIVED
**Original Location**: `/docs/specs/L3-FEATURES/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder-simplified.md`
**Archive Location**: `/docs/archive/2025-10-01-prompt-builder-cleanup/prompt-builder-simplified-2025-10-01.md`
**Last Modified**: 2025-10-01 09:28:21
**Description**: Interim simplified feature breakdown (created by subagent)

**Content Summary**:
- Feature ID: F-003-SIMPLIFIED
- Estimated Effort: 24-32 hours (3-4 days)
- Created: 2025-10-01 (earlier in the day)

**Why Archived**:
- REDUNDANT: Created ~6 minutes before `prompt-builder.md` was updated
- SUPERSEDED: `prompt-builder.md` contains all the same simplified vision
- DUPLICATE: Both files describe the same simplified approach
- CONFUSION: Having two L3 specs for the same feature violates single-source-of-truth principle
- INTERIM: This was a working document created by a subagent during the `/define-feature` process

**Key Differences from Source of Truth**:
- Slightly shorter (572 lines vs 644 lines)
- Less detailed architecture diagrams
- Fewer acceptance criteria
- Missing some implementation details
- Not as polished or complete

**Preserved for Historical Reference**:
- Shows the evolution of thinking during `/define-feature`
- Documents subagent's initial analysis
- Useful for understanding how we arrived at the final spec

---

### 3. `/PROMPT-BUILDER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
**Status**: ARCHIVED
**Original Location**: `/PROMPT-BUILDER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (root directory)
**Archive Location**: `/docs/archive/2025-10-01-prompt-builder-cleanup/PROMPT-BUILDER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2025-10-01.md`
**Last Modified**: 2025-10-01 09:32:33
**Description**: High-level implementation plan (created by orchestrator subagent)

**Content Summary**:
- Executive summary of simplified vision
- Architecture recommendations
- AI implementation options (Rule-Based vs LLM vs Hybrid)
- 4-phase implementation plan
- Validation against user vision

**Why Archived**:
- WRONG LOCATION: Should be in `/docs/planning/` not root directory
- REDUNDANT: All content incorporated into `prompt-builder.md`
- INTERIM: This was a planning document, not a final spec
- SUPERSEDED: L3 spec and L4 tasks now contain this information in proper format

**Why Not in `/docs/planning/`**:
- Content is fully integrated into formal L3 specification
- Not a planning conversation record (those go in `/docs/planning/`)
- Was an intermediate deliverable during `/define-feature` process
- Archive preserves it for historical context

**Preserved for Historical Reference**:
- Shows orchestrator's initial architecture analysis
- Documents decision-making process (Rule-Based vs LLM)
- Includes subagent coordination details

---

### 4. `/docs/specs/L4-TASKS/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder-tasks.md`
**Status**: KEPT (Active)
**Last Modified**: 2025-10-01 (created during `/define-feature`)
**Description**: L4 Task Breakdown (24 atomic tasks)

**Content Summary**:
- Total Tasks: 24 atomic tasks
- Total Effort: 32-40 hours
- Organized into 4 implementation phases
- Each task includes acceptance criteria and test requirements

**Why Kept**:
- CORRECT LAYER: L4 tasks are the proper next step after L3 spec
- REFERENCES SOURCE OF TRUTH: Built from `prompt-builder.md`
- READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION: Tasks are atomic and testable
- NO REDUNDANCY: Only L4 breakdown in existence

**Relationship to Source of Truth**:
- Directly derived from `prompt-builder.md`
- Maintains same 4-phase structure
- Breaks down each phase into 1-2 hour tasks
- Total effort aligns with L3 estimate (32-40 hours)

## Redundancy Analysis

### Identified Conflicts

#### 1. Two L3 Specifications
**Problem**: Both `prompt-builder.md` and `prompt-builder-simplified.md` claim to be L3 specifications
**Resolution**: Keep `prompt-builder.md` as it is:
- More comprehensive
- More recently updated (6 minutes later)
- Better aligned with documentation standards
- Properly integrated with L4 tasks

#### 2. Content Duplication
**Problem**: ~80% content overlap between the two L3 specs
**Examples**:
- Both describe single text input approach
- Both outline 50+ template system
- Both define 4 implementation phases
- Both include same effort estimates (with minor variance)

**Resolution**: Archive the less complete version

#### 3. Planning Document in Root
**Problem**: `PROMPT-BUILDER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` in root violates documentation structure
**Expected Location**: Either `/docs/planning/` or incorporated into `/docs/specs/`
**Resolution**: Archive since content is fully integrated into L3 spec

## Naming Convention Clarification

### Why "prompt-builder.md" and not "prompt-builder-simplified.md"?

The user was correct to question this. Here's what happened:

1. **Original State**: `prompt-builder.md` existed with complex form spec (54-72 hours)
2. **User Clarification**: User requested simplified version (single text input)
3. **Subagent Process**: During `/define-feature`, a subagent created `prompt-builder-simplified.md`
4. **Orchestrator Update**: Orchestrator UPDATED `prompt-builder.md` with simplified spec (not -simplified.md)
5. **Result**: Two files with ~80% overlap, both claiming to be "simplified"

**Resolution**:
- Keep `prompt-builder.md` as the canonical name
- The file header clearly states "Prompt Builder (Simplified)"
- The "Updated" field shows 2025-10-01 with note "(Simplified based on user vision)"
- This follows the principle: one feature = one L3 file

**Alternative Considered**:
- Could have renamed to `prompt-builder-simplified.md`
- Decision: Keep standard naming (`prompt-builder.md`) since the simplified version IS the current spec
- Old complex version was never formally documented (was in L2 epic only)

---

## Lessons Learned

### For Future Documentation
1. **Subagent Coordination**: When multiple subagents work on same feature, consolidate before finalizing
2. **File Naming**: Don't create variant filenames (-simplified, -v2, etc.) - update the canonical file
3. **Interim Artifacts**: Planning documents should go directly to `/docs/planning/` or be integrated immediately
4. **Single Source of Truth**: Only one L3 spec per feature, clearly marked as authoritative

### For Project Standards
1. **Archive Promptly**: When specs are superseded, archive immediately with dated folders
2. **Preserve History**: Always keep archived versions for reference, never delete
3. **Document Changes**: Create cleanup summaries to explain what happened and why
4. **Cross-Reference Check**: Always grep for references before archiving

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. âœ… Archive redundant files
2. âœ… Create this cleanup summary
3. âœ… Verify cross-references (none found)
4. âœ… Confirm source of truth clearly identified

### Before Implementation
1. Review L3 spec: `/docs/specs/L3-FEATURES/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder.md`
2. Review L4 tasks: `/docs/specs/L4-TASKS/ai-generation-pipeline/prompt-builder-tasks.md`
3. Verify alignment between L3 and L4
4. Begin implementation with `/implement-task T-003-001`

### Documentation Hygiene
1. Periodically check for duplicate specs
2. Ensure subagent artifacts are properly integrated
3. Keep `/docs/archive/` organized by date and feature
4. Maintain cleanup summaries for all major consolidations

## Questions Answered

### User's Original Question
> "So it sounds like we updated prompt-builder.md and that should be the new source of truth? And do we archive the old?"

**Answer**:
- âœ… YES: `prompt-builder.md` is the source of truth
- âœ… YES: Archived `prompt-builder-simplified.md` (was interim/redundant)
- âœ… YES: Archived `PROMPT-BUILDER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (was interim/misplaced)
- âœ… CLARIFICATION: The "old" version wasn't a previous `prompt-builder.md`, it was the parallel `-simplified.md` file created during the `/define-feature` process

### What the User Might Have Meant
The user may have been asking:
1. "Is there an old complex-form version to archive?"
   - **Answer**: No, the complex form only existed in the L2 Epic description, not as a separate L3 file
2. "Should we keep -simplified.md as the name?"
   - **Answer**: No, `prompt-builder.md` is the correct canonical name, and it now contains the simplified spec
