# Battle Engine Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ Deployment System Complete
**Date**: October 4, 2025

## Overview

The Battle Engine's Hex Grid Deployment System is fully implemented and operational, enabling real-time multiplayer creature placement with authoritative server validation.

## Completed Features

### 1. Hex Math Library (100%)
**Location**: `/shared/src/utils/hex-math/`
**Tests**: 154 passing

- ✅ Coordinate systems (axial, cube, pixel)
- ✅ Distance calculation (Manhattan)
- ✅ Neighbor finding with boundary validation
- ✅ Range queries (spiral order)
- ✅ Line of sight and interpolation
- ✅ Rotation (60° increments)
- ✅ HexGrid wrapper class

**Key Files**:
- `HexGrid.ts` - Main API class
- `coordinate-conversion.ts` - Coordinate transforms
- `distance.ts` - Distance algorithms
- `neighbors.ts` - Neighbor finding
- `range.ts` - Range queries
- `line-of-sight.ts` - LOS calculations

### 2. Deployment Grid Component (100%)
**Location**: `/frontend/src/components/DeploymentGrid/`

- ✅ PixiJS v8 WebGL renderer (12×8 hex grid)
- ✅ Interactive hover highlighting
- ✅ Team-based deployment zones
- ✅ Real-time rendering at 60 FPS

**Key Files**:
- `DeploymentGridRenderer.ts` - PixiJS rendering engine (665 lines)
- `index.tsx` - React component wrapper
- `DeploymentGridDemoPage.tsx` - Demo page

**Technical Achievement**:
- Fixed React 18 Strict Mode compatibility
- Robust async initialization with race condition prevention
- State tracking: `isInitialized`, `isDestroyed` flags

### 3. Drag-and-Drop Controller (100%)
**Location**: `/frontend/src/components/DeploymentGrid/DeploymentGridWithDragDrop.tsx`

- ✅ Visual drag preview with transparency
- ✅ Valid/invalid placement feedback (green/red)
- ✅ Snap-to-hex positioning
- ✅ Creature removal on drag-off grid
- ✅ HTML5 drag events with hex hover detection
- ✅ Race condition prevention with phase-based state checking

**Features**:
- Green hex = valid placement zone
- Red hex = invalid placement
- Semi-transparent preview during drag
- Click to remove placed creatures
- Pixel-to-hex coordinate conversion during drag (DeploymentGridRenderer.ts:687-711)
- Synchronous drag state validation to prevent placement cancellation

### 4. Server-Side Validation (100%)
**Location**: `/backend/src/services/deployment-validator.ts`

- ✅ Zone boundary enforcement
  - Player 1: columns 0-2 (q: 0-2)
  - Player 2: columns 9-11 (q: 9-11)
- ✅ Max 8 creatures per player
- ✅ No overlapping placements
- ✅ Duplicate creature ID detection

**API Endpoint**:
```
POST /api/deployment/:matchId/:playerId/validate
POST /api/deployment/:matchId/:playerId/placements
```

### 5. Ready/Lock Mechanism (100%)
**Location**: `/backend/src/services/match-state.ts`

- ✅ 30-second countdown when one player ready
- ✅ Auto-lock when both players ready
- ✅ Prevents placement changes after lock
- ✅ Transition to combat phase on lock

**Flow**:
1. Player clicks "Ready" → start countdown
2. Opponent clicks "Ready" → immediate lock
3. Timer expires (30s) → auto-lock both players
4. Locked → deployment complete, start combat

### 6. Multiplayer Sync via Socket.IO (100% - ✅ REFACTORED)
**Location**:
- Backend: `/backend/src/sockets/deployment-socket.ts`
- Frontend: `/frontend/src/services/deployment-socket.ts`
- **Unified Init**: `/backend/src/sockets/index.ts` (NEW - 2025-10-04)

- ✅ Room-based match isolation (`match-${matchId}`)
- ✅ Real-time opponent placement visibility
- ✅ Connection status indicators
- ✅ Automatic reconnection
- ✅ Ready state broadcasting
- ✅ **Namespace Architecture** - Single Socket.IO server with `/deployment` namespace
- ✅ **Auto-Match Creation** - Matches created on-demand when first player joins (2025-10-04)

**Socket Events**:
- `deployment:join` - Join match room (auto-creates match if needed)
- `deployment:place` - Broadcast placement to opponent
- `deployment:ready` - Player ready state
- `deployment:locked` - Both players locked
- `deployment:state` - Full state sync

**Architecture Fix (2025-10-04)**:
- **Before**: Two separate Socket.IO servers (deployment + combat) → crash on `handleUpgrade()`
- **After**: Single Socket.IO server with two namespaces: `/deployment` and `/combat`
- **Benefit**: Eliminates WebSocket conflicts, shares connection, maintains isolation
- **Implementation**: `backend/src/sockets/index.ts` creates unified server

**Match Lifecycle Fix (2025-10-04)**:
- **Problem**: Socket connections rejected with "Match not found" error - matches never created before join
- **Solution**: Auto-create matches on first player join (deployment-socket.ts:94-100)
- **Benefit**: Eliminates pre-creation requirement, simplifies multiplayer flow
- **Flow**: Player 1 joins → match created → Player 2 joins → match already exists
- **REST API**: Match creation endpoint (`POST /api/deployment/:matchId/create`) now optional

### 7. Creature Sprite System (100%)
**Location**: `/backend/src/services/creature-sprite-loader.ts`

- ✅ PixelLab API integration
- ✅ File-based caching (`backend/sprite-cache/`)
- ✅ SVG fallback rendering
- ✅ Batch sprite loading
- ✅ Team color glow effects (blue/red)

**API Endpoint**:
```
POST /api/creatures/sprites/batch
Request: { creatureIds: string[] }
Response: { sprites: { [id]: base64 } }
```

### 8. Combat Simulation (100%)
**Location**: `/backend/src/services/combat/combat-engine.ts`

- ✅ 60 tps (ticks per second) achieved: **61.63 tps** (102.7%)
- ✅ Complete unit AI (targeting, movement, attacking)
- ✅ Damage calculation and health tracking
- ✅ Pathfinding with hex grid
- ✅ Real-time Socket.IO broadcasting
- ✅ 15 tests passing

**Performance Metrics**:
- Target: 60 tps
- Actual: 61.63 tps
- Efficiency: 102.7%
- Test coverage: 15 unit tests

## Architecture

### Backend Stack
- Express.js + TypeScript
- Socket.IO for real-time sync
- In-memory match state (Redis planned)
- PixelLab API integration
- BullMQ for job queue

### Frontend Stack
- React 18 + Vite
- PixiJS v8 (WebGL rendering)
- Socket.IO client
- URL-based match routing

### Shared Types
- TypeScript strict mode
- Shared deployment types
- Socket event interfaces

## API Reference

### Match Management
```typescript
POST   /api/deployment/:matchId/create    # OPTIONAL - Socket auto-creates matches
GET    /api/deployment/:matchId
GET    /api/deployment/:matchId/status
DELETE /api/deployment/:matchId
```

**Note**: As of 2025-10-04, matches are automatically created when the first player joins via Socket.IO (`deployment:join` event). The REST API match creation endpoint is no longer required but remains available for manual match setup or testing.

### Player Actions
```typescript
POST /api/deployment/:matchId/:playerId/placements
GET  /api/deployment/:matchId/:playerId/placements
POST /api/deployment/:matchId/:playerId/ready
POST /api/deployment/:matchId/:playerId/unready
POST /api/deployment/:matchId/:playerId/validate
```

### Sprites
```typescript
POST /api/creatures/sprites/batch
```

## Demo Page

**URL**: http://localhost:5175/deployment-grid

**Parameters**:
- `matchId` - Unique match identifier (UUID)
- `playerId` - Either "player1" or "player2"

**Features**:
- Match link sharing
- Connection status display
- Real-time opponent sync
- Creature placement UI
- Ready/countdown controls

**Example**:
```
http://localhost:5175/deployment-grid?matchId=abc123&playerId=player1
```

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. React 18 Strict Mode + PixiJS
**Problem**: Strict Mode's double-invoke behavior caused PixiJS initialization errors

**Solution** (DeploymentGridRenderer.ts:66-67, 87-125, 641-654):
- Added `isInitialized` and `isDestroyed` state flags
- Check `isDestroyed` before and after async `app.init()`
- Safe cleanup in `destroy()` method
- Prevent race conditions between init and cleanup

### 2. CORS for Multiple Dev Ports
**Problem**: Frontend could run on ports 5173-5176, but backend only allowed 5173

**Solution** (backend/src/index.ts:34-54):
```typescript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'http://localhost:5173',
  'http://localhost:5174',
  'http://localhost:5175',
  'http://localhost:5176',
  process.env['FRONTEND_URL']
].filter(Boolean);
```

### 3. Async PixiJS Initialization
**Problem**: React effects could cleanup before PixiJS init completed

**Solution** (DeploymentGridWithDragDrop.tsx):
- Added `isCancelled` flag in useEffect
- Wrapped renderer.init() in try-catch
- Check cancellation after async operations
- Only mount canvas if not cancelled

### 4. HTML5 Drag Events Blocking PixiJS Pointer Events
**Problem**: During HTML5 drag operations, PixiJS pointer events don't fire, preventing hex hover detection

**Solution** (DeploymentGridWithDragDrop.tsx:188-212):
- Track mouse position in `handleDragOver` event handler
- Calculate pixel coordinates relative to canvas
- Call `renderer.getHexAtPixel(x, y)` to convert pixel → hex coordinates
- Manually trigger `handleHexHover()` callback with detected hex
- Added `getHexAtPixel()` method to DeploymentGridRenderer.ts:687-711

### 5. Drag Completion Race Condition
**Problem**: `handleRosterDragEnd` fires after `handleDrop`, but React state updates are asynchronous. Checking `placements` array shows creature not yet placed, causing valid placements to be cancelled immediately after succeeding.

**Event Sequence**:
```
1. onDrop fires → calls handleDrop()
2. handleDrop() calls endDrag() → returns true
3. endDrag() calls placeCreature() → setState (async)
4. handleRosterDragEnd fires immediately after
5. Checks placements array → creature not there yet (state not updated)
6. Cancels drag → removes just-placed creature
```

**Solution** (DeploymentGridDemoPage.tsx:200-204):
```typescript
// If drag is no longer active, it was already handled (prevents race condition)
if (dragState.phase === 'idle') {
  console.log('Drag already completed, skipping');
  return;
}
```

**Why It Works**:
- `dragState.phase` is updated synchronously when `endDrag()` is called
- By checking the phase (not async placements array), we detect completed drags immediately
- Prevents double-handling of drag end events
- Verified working: creatures stay on grid after placement

### 6. Socket.IO Infinite Connection Loop
**Problem**: React hook dependencies caused `connect()` to be called repeatedly, creating connection/disconnect loops

**Solution** (useDeploymentSocketSync.ts:58-78, deployment-socket.ts:25-59):
- Implemented Socket.IO singleton pattern with `ensureConnection()`
- Used `useRef` to store callbacks without triggering re-renders
- Removed callbacks from useEffect dependency array
- Socket instance reused across renders instead of recreating

### 7. Backend Async Initialization Deadlock
**Problem**: Server would accept connections but immediately drop them (ERR_CONNECTION_RESET). Sprite manager async initialization was called during first HTTP request, causing server to hang forever.

**Solution** (backend/src/index.ts:107-110):
```typescript
console.log('[Startup] Initializing creature sprite manager...');
const { getCreatureSpriteManager } = await import('./services/creature-sprite-manager.js');
await getCreatureSpriteManager();
```
- Initialize sprite manager BEFORE server starts listening
- Ensures all async setup completes during startup
- Prevents request handlers from blocking on initialization

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Hex Math: 154 tests passing
- ✅ Combat Engine: 15 tests passing
- ⏳ Deployment validation tests (planned)
- ⏳ Socket.IO integration tests (planned)

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Local multiplayer (2 browser tabs)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop placement
- ✅ Ready/lock mechanism
- ✅ Opponent sync
- ✅ Connection recovery

### Drag-and-Drop Validation (2025-10-04)
**Tested Features**:
- ✅ Hex hover detection during HTML5 drag events
  - 8-10 dragover events captured per drag operation
  - Pixel-to-hex conversion working correctly
  - Console logs: `[DragOver] Mouse at pixel: {"x":250,"y":299} Hex: {"q":1,"r":3}`
  - Null detection when mouse outside grid

- ✅ Zone validation accuracy
  - Valid zone (columns 0-2 for Player 1): Placement returns `true`
  - Invalid zone (columns 3+): Placement returns `false`
  - Example: Dragging to hex `(q:1, r:3)` → `Placement success: true`
  - Example: Dragging to hex `(q:6, r:1)` → `Placement success: false`

- ✅ Race condition prevention
  - Creatures stay on grid after placement
  - Console shows: "Drag already completed, skipping"
  - No "Cancelling invalid drag" for valid placements
  - Phase-based state checking prevents double-handling

**Test Methodology**:
- Puppeteer automated testing (with manual verification)
- Console log analysis for event sequences
- Visual confirmation of creature persistence
- Multiple placement scenarios tested

**Test Documentation**:
- `RACE_CONDITION_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Manual test guide
