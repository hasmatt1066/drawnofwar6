# Ghost Trail Elimination - Documentation Index

This directory contains all documentation related to the ghost trail visualization bug that affected combat rendering in the Draw of War 6 game.

## Timeline Overview

The ghost trail bug was a critical visualization issue where creature sprites would leave duplicate "ghost" copies on the battlefield when moving. The investigation and resolution spanned from October 20-25, 2025.

  - Base64 image support
- **Status:** Major progress

### 6. Complete Resolution
**[GHOST_TRAIL_ELIMINATION_SUCCESS.md](./GHOST_TRAIL_ELIMINATION_SUCCESS.md)**
- **Date:** October 25, 2025
- **Focus:** Final verification and success report
- **Resolution:** All ghost trail issues completely eliminated
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Summary

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Double Positioning Bug** (Player 1 invisible sprites)
   - Sprites positioned absolutely before being added to containers
   - Containers also positioned absolutely
   - Result: Coordinates doubled, sprites rendered off-screen

2. **Position-Based Sprite Tracking** (Player 2 ghost trails)
   - Fallback rendering used position hash instead of unitId
   - Moving units created new sprites at new positions
   - Old sprites not removed (different hash keys)
   - Result: Trail of abandoned sprites

3. **Base64 Image Format** (Placeholder sprites failing)
   - Raw base64 data not recognized by PixiJS
   - Required proper data URI format with MIME type

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed Sprite Positioning**
   - Sprites positioned at (0,0) relative to container
   - Only container positioned at hex coordinate
   - Eliminates coordinate doubling

2. **UnitId-Based Tracking**
   - All sprites tracked by unitId in `animatedSprites` Map
   - In-place position updates instead of recreation
   - Prevents ghost trails for all sprite types

3. **Base64 Normalization**
   - Auto-detection of raw base64 data
   - Automatic conversion to proper data URI format
   - Support for PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG formats

## System Capabilities (Post-Fix)

- ✅ Animated sprites with directional views
- ✅ Static sprites from URLs
- ✅ Base64 placeholder sprites
- ✅ UnitId-based tracking (ghost trail prevention)
- ✅ Team color glows
- ✅ Mixed sprite types in same battle

## Technical Impact

### Performance Improvements
- Eliminated sprite duplication overhead
- O(1) sprite lookups via unitId Map
- In-place updates reduce GC pressure
- Fewer active sprites in memory

### Code Quality
- Clear sprite lifecycle management
- Consistent tracking mechanism across all sprite types
- Robust error handling for image formats
- Better separation of concerns

## Testing Evidence

**Screenshot:** `/screenshots/visualizationcheck.png`
- Tested at tick 215+ of combat
- Player 1: Animated sprite (Mysterious Robed Wizard)
- Player 2: Base64 placeholder sprite (Cleric)
- Result: Zero ghost trails, both sprites rendering correctly

## Related Systems

This fix affected the following components:
- `CombatGridRenderer.ts` - Primary implementation
- `DeploymentGridRenderer.ts` - Base class providing shared rendering
- `combat-visualization-manager.ts` - Visualization orchestration
- Combat state management - Unit tracking and positioning

## Lessons Learned

1. **Coordinate Systems Matter** - Mixing absolute and relative positioning causes compound errors
2. **Unique Identifiers Over Position** - Position-based tracking fails when entities move
3. **Data Format Validation** - Image data needs proper MIME type wrapping for browser APIs
4. **Incremental Debugging** - Multi-day investigation revealed layered issues requiring sequential fixes

## Future Considerations

- Monitor for edge cases in production
- Consider texture preloading for base64 sprites
- Potential optimization: sprite pooling for frequently spawned units
- Document coordinate system conventions for future developers

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - All ghost trail issues eliminated
