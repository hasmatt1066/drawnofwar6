# Drawn of War - Project Status

**Last Updated**: October 4, 2025

## What's Working

### Text-to-Animated-Sprite Generation (Fully Functional)

The core generation pipeline is **complete and operational**:

1. **User Input**: Enter text description (e.g., "fire dragon warrior")
2. **Base Sprite**: PixelLab generates 64x64 sprite with transparent background
3. **AI Analysis**: Claude Vision analyzes sprite to extract abilities and characteristics
4. **Animation Mapping**: 20-21 animations assigned based on creature type
5. **Combat Attributes**: 1-3 special abilities extracted with sprite overlays
6. **Walk Animation**: PixelLab creates 4-frame walk cycle
7. **Display**: React component shows creature with dynamic combat attributes
8. **Processing Time**: ~30-50 seconds end-to-end

**Key Configuration**:
- Sprite size: 64x64 pixels (required for animation)
- View angle: 'side' (matches walk animation direction)
- Background: Transparent (`no_background: true`)
- Animation: 4-frame walk cycle
- AI-driven animation assignment: 20-21 animations per creature
- Combat attributes: 2 primary abilities with effect animations (Fire Breath, Fire Spell, Teleport, etc.)

### Combat Attributes System (✅ PRODUCTION VERIFIED)

**Status**: ✅ AI-driven combat attribute assignment **fully operational and tested in production**

**Production Test** (2025-10-04):
- **Test Input**: "cute cat with flamethrower"
- **Processing Time**: 34.7 seconds
- **Cost**: $0.009378 (Claude Vision only)
- **Attributes Assigned**: Fire Spell, Tail Whip, Roar
- **Effect Frames Loaded**: 12 frames total (4 per attribute)
- **Result**: ✅ Complete end-to-end success

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **AI Analysis** - Claude Vision analyzes all generated creatures (text, draw, upload)
- ✅ **Ability Extraction** - Identifies creature capabilities from visual analysis
- ✅ **Attribute Mapping** - 55 combat attributes mapped to sprite animations
- ✅ **Smart Selection** - Top 3 primary abilities selected by priority
- ✅ **Effect Frames** - Pre-generated 4-frame animations for each attribute
- ✅ **Dynamic Display** - CombatAttributeDisplay component shows AI-assigned attributes
- ✅ **Sprite Compositing** - Effect overlays on creature sprite with `mixBlendMode: 'screen'`
- ✅ **Attack Type Detection** - Automatic melee/ranged classification
- ✅ **Production Testing** - Verified working end-to-end with real creatures

### Animation Library System (Complete)

**Status**: ✅ All 55 library animations generated and validated

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **55 Pre-generated Effects** - Idle, locomotion, combat, abilities, reactions
- ✅ **Asset Storage** - Animations stored at `/assets/library-animations/`
- ✅ **Backend Loading** - Async effect frame loading from library
- ✅ **AI-Driven Assignment** - Smart animation selection based on creature capabilities
- ✅ **Isolated Effects** - Universal overlays work on any creature sprite
- ✅ **Blend Modes** - CSS `screen` blend for magical glow effects

**Effect Categories**:
- Idle (5): Breathing, alert, tired, flying
- Locomotion (12): Walk, run, fly, glide, swim, jump, dash, teleport
- Combat (15): Melee attacks (sword, punch, claw, bite), ranged (bow, throw), defend, dodge
- Abilities (15): Spell casting (fire, ice, lightning), heal, buff, breathe fire, roar, special moves
- Reactions (8): Hit, death, celebrate, stun, scared, knockback, revive

**Proof-of-Concept Components**:
1. **SpellCastDemo** - Validates ranged attack compositing
   - Effect overlays on caster during cast
   - Spawns projectile when cast completes
   - Projectile travels to target with frame animation
   - Distance-based hit detection

2. **MeleeAttackDemo** - Validates melee attack compositing
   - Effect positioned in front of attacker (offset positioning)
   - Frame-based hit detection (triggers on frame 3)
   - Target flashes white on hit
   - No projectile system needed

### Multi-View Angle Generation (Complete)

**Status**: ✅ UI testing tool implemented and ready

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **View Angle Testing UI** - Interactive comparison tool at `/test-view-angles`
- ✅ **3 Camera Angles** - Side (profile), low top-down (~20°), high top-down (~35°)
- ✅ **Automated Generation** - Single click generates all 3 views with walk animations
- ✅ **Visual Comparison** - Side-by-side display with animation playback
- ✅ **Cost/Time Tracking** - Shows per-view and total metrics

**Available Views**:
- **Side** - Profile view for menus/galleries/portraits (~90° angle)
- **Low Top-Down** - Slight overhead for RTS-style (~20° angle)
- **High Top-Down** - Traditional isometric (~35° angle)

**API Endpoint**:
- `POST /api/test/view-angles` - Generate all 3 views with walk cycles

### Battlefield View Integration (✅ PRODUCTION READY - ENHANCED)

**Status**: ✅ Multi-directional sprite system **fully implemented and production-tested** (2025-10-07)

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **Multi-Directional Generation** - 3 unique directional sprites (E, NE, SE) + 3 mirrored (W, NW, SW)
- ✅ **Rotation API Approach** - Uses PixelLab `/v1/rotate` endpoint for better visual consistency
- ✅ **Cost-Optimized** - 50% savings through CSS transform mirroring strategy
- ✅ **Directional Rendering** - DeploymentGridRenderer selects sprite based on creature facing
- ✅ **CSS Transform Mirroring** - W, NW, SW directions use horizontal flip (scale.x = -1)
- ✅ **DirectionalAnimationStudio** - New component showcases all 6 directions in grid layout
- ✅ **Animation Studio Integration** - View angle selector + directional showcase
- ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Legacy single battlefield sprite system fully supported
- ✅ **Non-Fatal Generation** - Battlefield view failure doesn't block creature creation
- ✅ **Production Verified** - Successfully tested with dragon creature (job ID 1)

**How It Works**:
1. **Menu View** (Side profile) - For character menus, galleries, selection screens
2. **Battlefield Directional Views** (Low top-down ~20°) - 6-directional hex grid tactical display
   - **Base Generation**: Single side-view sprite generated first
   - **Rotation API**: `/v1/rotate` endpoint rotates base to E, NE, SE directions
   - **Walk Animations**: 4-frame walk animations generated for each rotated sprite
   - **Mirrored**: W (West), NW (Northwest), SW (Southwest) via CSS transforms
3. **Dynamic Selection** - Renderer chooses sprite based on creature's facing direction
4. **Fallback Logic** - Missing directional sprites gracefully degrade to legacy battlefield or menu sprites

**Why Rotation API Instead of Direction Parameter**:
- **Better Consistency**: Rotating from single base sprite maintains visual coherence
- **Improved Quality**: Not 100% fidelity yet, but significantly better than direction parameter approach
- **Same Cost**: 3 rotations + 3 walk animations ≈ $0.08 USD per creature
- **Mirroring Strategy**: Still uses 3 generated + 3 mirrored for cost efficiency

**Cost Impact**:
- **Phase 1**: ~$0.01 per creature (menu sprites only)
- **Phase 2**: ~$0.02 per creature (menu + single battlefield sprite) [DEPRECATED]
- **Phase 3**: ~$0.08 per creature (menu + 3 rotated directional sprites + 3 walk animations)
- **Phase 4** (Current): ~$0.236 per creature (Phase 3 + 3 idle animations)
  - Idle animations: 3 directions × 4 frames × ~$0.013 = ~$0.156 additional cost
  - **Value**: Living battlefield with subtle breathing animations vs static sprites
- **Cost Per Direction**: ~$0.013 USD (50% savings vs generating all 6 directions)
- **Value**: Full 6-directional coverage for immersive hex grid gameplay

**Technical Details**:
- **Generation Pipeline**: Side view → Rotate to E/NE/SE → Animate each direction → Mirror for W/NW/SW
- **Rotation Service**: `/backend/src/pixellab/rotate-sprite.ts` - `RotateSprite` class with helper methods
- **Step 6 Process**:
  1. Generate base side-view sprite
  2. Loop through 3 directions (E, NE, SE)
  3. Rotate base sprite using `/v1/rotate` endpoint
  4. Generate 4-frame walk animation for rotated sprite
- **Data Model**: `BattlefieldDirectionalViews` type with E, NE, SE directional sprites
- **Renderer**: Direction-based sprite selection with CSS transform mirroring for W, NW, SW
- **Animation Studio**: View angle selector + DirectionalAnimationStudio component (6-direction grid)

**Documentation**:
- Complete Guide: `/docs/features/MULTI_DIRECTIONAL_SPRITES.md` (comprehensive implementation details)
- L3 Spec: `/docs/specs/L3-BATTLEFIELD-VIEW-GENERATION.md`
- Implementation Report: `/docs/implementation-reports/BATTLEFIELD_VIEW_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`

**Files Modified** (9 total):
- Backend: `types/generation.ts`, `queue/generation-processor.ts`, `pixellab/rotate-sprite.ts` (NEW)
- Shared: `types/deployment.ts`
- Frontend: `DeploymentGrid/DeploymentGridRenderer.ts`, `DirectionalAnimationStudio/index.tsx`, `pages/CreatureAnimationStudio.tsx`

**Production Status**: ✅ Complete and tested (2025-10-07)

#### Dynamic Creature Facing (Complete)

**Status**: ✅ Automatic facing direction based on movement **fully implemented** (2025-10-07)

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **Movement-Based Facing** - Creatures automatically face the direction they move
- ✅ **Default Team Facing** - Player 1 creatures face East, Player 2 creatures face West
- ✅ **Axial Coordinate Calculation** - Angle-based direction from coordinate deltas
- ✅ **6-Direction Mapping** - Maps to hex directions (NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW)
- ✅ **Renderer Integration** - Passes facing to DeploymentGridRenderer for sprite selection
- ✅ **Socket.IO Sync** - Facing automatically synchronized (part of CreaturePlacement type)

**How It Works**:
1. **Movement Detection** - When creature moves, calculate delta between old and new hex positions
2. **Angle Calculation** - Convert axial coordinate delta to angle using `Math.atan2()`
3. **Direction Mapping** - Map angle to one of 6 hex directions (60° sectors)
4. **Default Facing** - New placements use team-based default (Player 1: E, Player 2: W)
5. **Sprite Selection** - Renderer selects appropriate directional sprite based on facing

**Implementation Details**:
- **Facing Calculation** (`useDeploymentState.ts:calculateFacing()`):
  - Converts axial coordinates (q, r) to pixel offsets
  - Uses `Math.atan2(dy, dx)` for angle calculation
  - Maps angles to 6 directions: NE (30°-90°), E (330°-30°), SE (270°-330°), SW (210°-270°), W (150°-210°), NW (90°-150°)
- **Default Facing** (`useDeploymentState.ts:getDefaultFacing()`):
  - Player 1 (left side): East (creatures face right toward enemy)
  - Player 2 (right side): West (creatures face left toward enemy)
- **Integration** (`DeploymentGridWithDragDrop.tsx`):
  - Passes `creature.facing` to renderer for each placed creature
  - Renderer automatically selects correct directional sprite

**Files Modified**:
- `/frontend/src/components/DeploymentGrid/useDeploymentState.ts` - Added facing calculation logic
- `/frontend/src/components/DeploymentGrid/DeploymentGridWithDragDrop.tsx` - Updated renderer integration

**Technical Benefits**:
- Enhances visual immersion (creatures face their movement direction)
- Works seamlessly with multi-directional sprite system
- No additional API calls (uses existing directional sprites)
- Automatic synchronization via Socket.IO (facing already in data model)

## Recent Fixes (2025-10-04)

### Frontend API URL Configuration ✅
**Issue**: Frontend making requests to wrong port, bypassing Vite proxy
**Fix**: Changed all absolute URLs to relative paths in 6 files
- `frontend/src/services/deployment-socket.ts`
- `frontend/src/services/creature-sprite-loader.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/DeploymentGrid/useMatchSync.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/AnimationDebugger/AnimationDebugger.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/MeleeAttackDemo/MeleeAttackDemo.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/SpellCastDemo/SpellCastDemo.tsx`

**Result**: All API calls now properly proxied through Vite (`:5175 → :3001`)

### Socket.IO Architecture Refactor ✅
**Issue**: Multiple Socket.IO servers on same HTTP server causing crash
**Fix**: Unified Socket.IO server with namespaces
- Created: `backend/src/sockets/index.ts` (unified initialization)
- Modified: `backend/src/sockets/combat-socket.ts` (uses `/combat` namespace)
- Modified: `backend/src/sockets/deployment-socket.ts` (uses `/deployment` namespace)
- Modified: `backend/src/index.ts` (calls unified initialization)

**Result**: Single Socket.IO server with `/combat` and `/deployment` namespaces, no more crashes

### Drag-and-Drop Race Condition Fix ✅ (PRODUCTION VERIFIED)
**Issue**: Creatures placed successfully but immediately cancelled due to async state updates
**Event Sequence**:
```
1. onDrop fires → calls handleDrop()
2. endDrag() → placeCreature() → setState (async)
3. handleRosterDragEnd fires immediately
4. Checks placements array → creature not there yet
5. Cancels drag → removes just-placed creature
```
**Fix**: Check synchronous `dragState.phase` instead of async `placements` array
```typescript
// DeploymentGridDemoPage.tsx:200-204
if (dragState.phase === 'idle') {
  console.log('Drag already completed, skipping');
  return;
}
```
**Result**: Creatures persist on grid after placement (verified working in production)

### HTML5 Drag Event Integration ✅
**Issue**: PixiJS pointer events don't fire during HTML5 drag operations, breaking hex hover detection
**Fix**: Manual pixel-to-hex conversion in dragover handler
- Added `getHexAtPixel(x, y)` method to DeploymentGridRenderer.ts:687-711
- Track mouse position in `handleDragOver` (DeploymentGridWithDragDrop.tsx:188-212)
- Calculate canvas-relative coordinates and call `getHexAtPixel()`
- Manually trigger `handleHexHover()` with detected hex

**Result**: 8-10 dragover events per drag with accurate hex coordinate detection

### Socket.IO Infinite Connection Loop Fix ✅
**Issue**: React hook dependencies caused repeated `connect()` calls, creating connection/disconnect loops
**Fix**:
- Implemented Socket.IO singleton pattern with `ensureConnection()` (deployment-socket.ts:25-59)
- Used `useRef` to store callbacks without triggering re-renders (useDeploymentSocketSync.ts:58-78)
- Removed callbacks from useEffect dependency array
- Socket instance reused across renders

**Result**: Single stable connection, no more reconnect loops

### Backend Async Initialization Deadlock Fix ✅
**Issue**: Server accepted connections but immediately dropped them (ERR_CONNECTION_RESET). Sprite manager async initialization called during first HTTP request, causing server hang.
**Fix**: Initialize sprite manager BEFORE server starts listening (backend/src/index.ts:107-110)
```typescript
console.log('[Startup] Initializing creature sprite manager...');
const { getCreatureSpriteManager } = await import('./services/creature-sprite-manager.js');
await getCreatureSpriteManager();
```
**Result**: All async setup completes during startup, no request blocking

### Match Auto-Creation on Socket Join ✅
**Issue**: Deployment socket rejected connections with "Match not found" error - matches were never created before players tried to join.
**Fix**: Modified deployment socket handler to auto-create matches when first player joins (deployment-socket.ts:94-100)
```typescript
// Auto-create match if it doesn't exist
let matchState = matchStateService.getMatchState(matchId);
if (!matchState) {
  console.log(`[Deployment Socket] Match ${matchId} not found, creating new match...`);
  matchState = matchStateService.createMatch(matchId, 1);
  console.log(`[Deployment Socket] Match ${matchId} created successfully`);
}
```
**Impact**:
- ✅ Player 2 can now successfully place creatures on battlefield
- ✅ Multiplayer synchronization works correctly
- ✅ No more "Match not found" or "Must join match first" errors
- ✅ Matches created on-demand when first player joins
- ✅ REST API match creation endpoint now optional (Socket.IO handles auto-creation)

**Match Lifecycle Flow**:
1. Player 1 joins via Socket.IO → Match auto-created → Receives current state
2. Player 2 joins same matchId → Match already exists → Receives current state
3. Both players can place creatures and sync in real-time
4. No pre-creation via REST API required
