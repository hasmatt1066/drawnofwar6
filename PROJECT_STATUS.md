# Drawn of War - Project Status

**Last Updated**: October 4, 2025

## What's Working

### Text-to-Animated-Sprite Generation (Fully Functional)

The core generation pipeline is **complete and operational**:

1. **User Input**: Enter text description (e.g., "fierce dragon warrior")
2. **Base Sprite**: PixelLab generates 64x64 sprite with transparent background
3. **Animation**: PixelLab creates 4-frame walk cycle
4. **Display**: React component animates frames at 10 FPS
5. **Processing Time**: ~27 seconds end-to-end

**Key Configuration**:
- Sprite size: 64x64 pixels (required for animation)
- View angle: 'side' (matches walk animation direction)
- Background: Transparent (`no_background: true`)
- Animation: 4-frame walk cycle
- Animation assignment: AI-driven, 6-18 animations per creature based on type

### Animation Library System (Complete)

**Status**: ✅ All 55 library animations generated and validated

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **55 Pre-generated Effects** - Idle, locomotion, combat, abilities, reactions
- ✅ **API Endpoints** - Serve library animations via `/api/library-animations/`
- ✅ **AI-Driven Assignment** - Smart animation selection based on creature capabilities
- ✅ **Isolated Effects** - Universal overlays work on any creature sprite
- ✅ **SpellCastDemo** - Ranged effect compositing with projectiles (cast → travel → hit)
- ✅ **MeleeAttackDemo** - Melee effect compositing with frame-based hit detection
- ✅ **Blend Modes** - CSS `screen` blend validated for both ranged and melee

**Effect Categories**:
- Idle (5): Breathing, alert, tired, flying
- Locomotion (12): Walk, run, fly, glide, swim, jump, dash, teleport
- Combat (15): Melee attacks (sword, punch, claw, bite), ranged (bow, throw), defend, dodge
- Abilities (15): Spell casting (fire, ice, lightning), heal, buff, breathe fire, roar, special moves
- Reactions (8): Hit, death, celebrate, stun, scared, knockback, revive

**Proof-of-Concept Components**:
1. **SpellCastDemo** - Validates ranged attack compositing
   - Effect overlays on caster during cast
   - Spawns projectile when cast completes
   - Projectile travels to target with frame animation
   - Distance-based hit detection

2. **MeleeAttackDemo** - Validates melee attack compositing
   - Effect positioned in front of attacker (offset positioning)
   - Frame-based hit detection (triggers on frame 3)
   - Target flashes white on hit
   - No projectile system needed

### Multi-View Angle Generation (Complete)

**Status**: ✅ UI testing tool implemented and ready

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **View Angle Testing UI** - Interactive comparison tool at `/test-view-angles`
- ✅ **3 Camera Angles** - Side (profile), low top-down (~20°), high top-down (~35°)
- ✅ **Automated Generation** - Single click generates all 3 views with walk animations
- ✅ **Visual Comparison** - Side-by-side display with animation playback
- ✅ **Cost/Time Tracking** - Shows per-view and total metrics

**Available Views**:
- **Side** - Profile view for menus/galleries/portraits (~90° angle)
- **Low Top-Down** - Slight overhead for RTS-style (~20° angle)
- **High Top-Down** - Traditional isometric (~35° angle)

**API Endpoint**:
- `POST /api/test/view-angles` - Generate all 3 views with walk cycles
- Request: `{"description": "creature text", "size": 64}`
- Response: Base sprites + 4-frame animations for each view
- Cost: ~$0.12 per test (~$0.04 per view)
- Time: ~80 seconds total

**Next Steps**:
1. Test different creatures visually to choose best battlefield angle
2. Implement multi-view generation in main pipeline
3. Decide on directional walk strategy (single + flip vs 4-directional)
4. Update game rendering to reference appropriate view per context

### Battle Engine - Hex Grid Deployment System (Complete)

**Status**: ✅ Multiplayer deployment system fully operational

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **Hex Math Library** - Complete hexagonal grid mathematics (154 tests passing)
  - Axial, cube, and pixel coordinate systems
  - Distance calculation, neighbor finding, range queries
  - Line of sight, rotation, boundary validation
- ✅ **Deployment Grid Component** - PixiJS-powered 12×8 hex grid
  - Interactive hex highlighting on hover
  - Real-time rendering with WebGL
  - Team-based deployment zones (first 3 columns per player)
- ✅ **Drag-and-Drop Controller** - Intuitive creature placement
  - Visual drag preview with transparency
  - Valid/invalid placement feedback
  - Snap-to-hex positioning
- ✅ **Server-side Validation** - Authoritative deployment rules
  - Zone boundaries enforced (q: 0-2 for player1, q: 9-11 for player2)
  - Max 8 creatures per player
  - No overlapping placements
  - Duplicate creature ID detection
- ✅ **Ready/Lock Mechanism** - Deployment finalization flow
  - 30-second countdown timer when one player ready
  - Auto-lock when both players ready
  - Prevents changes after lock
- ✅ **Multiplayer Sync via Socket.IO** - Real-time deployment coordination
  - Room-based match isolation
  - Opponent placement visibility (50% opacity)
  - Connection status indicators
  - Automatic reconnection
- ✅ **Creature Sprite System** - Hybrid PixelLab + SVG rendering
  - PixelLab API integration with file caching
  - SVG fallbacks for reliability
  - Batch sprite loading
  - Team color glow effects (blue/red)
- ✅ **Combat Simulation** - 60 tps authoritative server
  - Achieved 61.63 tps (102.7% of target)
  - Complete unit AI (targeting, movement, attacking)
  - Damage calculation and health tracking
  - Real-time Socket.IO broadcasting
  - 15 tests passing

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/deployment/:matchId/create` - Create match
- `POST /api/deployment/:matchId/:playerId/placements` - Store placements
- `POST /api/deployment/:matchId/:playerId/ready` - Mark player ready
- `GET /api/deployment/:matchId/status` - Get deployment status
- `POST /api/creatures/sprites/batch` - Load creature sprites

**WebSocket Events**:
- `deployment:join` - Join match room
- `deployment:place` - Send placement to opponent
- `deployment:ready` - Broadcast ready state
- `deployment:locked` - Both players locked, start combat

**Technical Achievements**:
- Fixed React 18 Strict Mode compatibility with PixiJS

- CORS configured for multiple dev ports (5173-5176)
- In-memory match state with countdown timers

**Demo Page**: http://localhost:5175/deployment-grid

- Match sharing via link
- Connection status display
- Real-time opponent sync
